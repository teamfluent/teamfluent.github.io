    <h2>
      WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?
    </h2>

    <p>
    When someone visits one of our websites, we collect information on how the visitor uses the websites, what pages he or she visits, for how long, and similar usage statistics. We may also collect information on what web browser the visitor used, his or her language settings, which country or area he or she comes from, what website referred him or her to our site, what local network he or she uses, the visitor’s IP address and similar technical information. We keep track of this information across multiple visits. In most cases , we do not seek to identify the person visiting the websites, but some of the data that is collected may allow identifying the person in question.
    </p>

    <p>
    We collect the information directly from the visitor’s browser and connection. We may also use cookies to collect some of the information (more details on cookies can be viewed below). 
    </p>

    <p>
    Note that if you contact us through a web form, a separate policy may govern the information collected via the form and in any follow-up correspondence.
    </p>

    <h2>
    WHY DO WE COLLECT THE INFORMATION?
    </h2>

<p>
We collect the above information in order to publish websites and provide the information included therein, to know what information about us people find interesting, to optimize the performance, layout and content of the our websites and to market our products and services. Our legal basis to collect the information is TeamFluent’s legitimate interest to do this.
</p>

<h2>
  DO WE SHARE INFORMATION WITH OTHERS?
</h2>

<p>
TeamFluent generally does not share the information collected with anyone outside our company.
</p>

<p>
We may also use certain suppliers and contractors, in law referred to as data processors, to whom TeamFluent may transfer the information for limited technical purposes, or who may have access to it as part of the technical services they provide. In the event a data processor has access to any personal data, we have, as required by law, entered into written agreement with the data processor ensuring that they treat the data lawfully and in compliance with ourinstructions and this policy.
</p>

<p>
We may also disclose personal data to government entities and agencies as required by law.
</p>

<p>
Finally, we may use certain third-party analytical services as part of our websites. When you visit one of our websites, your browser may provide some or all of the above-mentioned information to an analytical service. One of the services we are using is Google Analytics. To learn more about Google Analytics and to opt-out of certain Google Analytics data collection practices, please visit this site: <a href="https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/">https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/</a>.
</p>

<h2>
  HOW DOES TEAMFLUENT USE COOKIES?
</h2>

<p>
We may use cookies to collect some of the abovementioned information. A cookie is a small text file saved by your browser onto your computer or other device. We generally do not use cookies to specifically identify anyone (as explained above), but to separate one user from the other. This allows us to, e.g., keep track of a visitor moving around on the websites even if we do not know who that user is. Without cookies, we would not be able to provide features such as logging-in or remembering language, country or other preferences.
</p>

<p>
Note that some of our third-party analytical services also may set their own cookies. For more information on this, please visit the links provided above.
</p>

<p>
Where relevant, you may withdraw your consent for us to use cookies at any time by managing your preferences.
</p>

<p>
You can also use your browser settings to disable use of cookies on our websites. Your web browser may also allow you more sophisticated control of which cookies you want to permit and which you want to block. Please check your browser’s settings or manual.
</p>

<h2>
  WHERE DO WE TRANSFER INFORMATION?
</h2>

<p>
Some of our data processors and other recipients of personal data may be located outside the European Union or the European Economic Area, where the local data protection laws may be less strict than those adopted in the European Union.
</p>

<p>
In the event that we disclose or transfer personal data outside the EU/EEA, we always ensure that appropriate safeguards are applied to protect the data.
</p>

<p>
In most cases, we will do this by including the EU Commission’s relevant model clauses into our agreement with the recipient. The clauses ensure that the data is treated fairly outside the EU/EEA. In some cases, however, we may also transfer data outside the EU/EEA without including the model clauses. In these cases, either (i) the relevant country has been held to have local data protection laws meeting EU standards (by an adequacy decision of the EU commission) or (ii) the relevant recipient company, if located in the United States, has signed up to the EU-approved Privacy Shield programme.
</p>

<h2>
HOW LONG DO WE STORE THE INFORMATION?
</h2>

<p>
In general, we store the above-mentioned information for about three years from your time of visit on our website. We may also use the information to put together aggregate-level statistics that are not identifiable personal data – such non-identifiable statistics may be kept indefinitely.
</p>

<h2>
  YOUR RIGHTS
</h2>

<p>
In addition to other legal rights you may have, you may have the following rights in respect of any personal data we collect about you:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>To ask that we provide you a copy of any identifiable personal data concerning you as well as certain information about how we processe your personal data.</li>
  <li>To ask that we correct any incorrect or deficient identifiable personal data we hold concerning you.</li>
  <li>To ask that we erase any such identifiable personal data concerning you that we do not have a legal basis to hold.</li>
  <li>To ask that we, instead of erasing data in the above situation, restrict further processing of the data while still keeping a copy.</li>
  <li>To ask that we similarly restrict processing of the data while you await our response to another lawful request by you that we stop processing data concerning you.</li>
  <li>To object, on grounds relating to your particular situation, to TeamFluent having a sufficient legitimate interest to collect some specific identifiable personal data concerning you.</li>
  <li>To object to TeamFluent using personal data concerning you for direct marketing purposes.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Should you wish to exercise any of these rights, you may contact us using the contact details provided above. We will respond as soon as it is possible, and in any event within a month of your request. If TeamFluent for some reason disagrees with your request, we will state our reasons for doing so.
</p>

<p>
If you feel that TeamFluent has not processed your personal data in a lawful manner, you have a legal right to send a complaint to the data protection supervisor of the EU country where you live or work. You may also send the complaint to the data protection supervisor of the country where you consider that the illegal conduct took place.
