<h2>
4. ADDITIONAL END USER OBLIGATIONS:
</h2>

<p>
 End User shall have sole responsibility for acquiring and maintaining its own technology environment, including but not limited to PC’s, operating systems, servers, Internet access, local area networks, and wide area networks. 
</p>

<p>
End User agrees to comply with TeamFluent’s procedures and security measures associated with access to the Software and the Site (the “TeamFluent Procedures”), which will be maintained by TeamFluent on the Site and are incorporated by reference in this Agreement. TeamFluent may revise the TeamFluent Procedures from time to time.
</p>

<p>
TeamFluent may in its sole discretion deny or remove access to any user of the Software or Site (“User”) who fails to abide by the TeamFluent Procedures or who otherwise tampers with or abuses the Site or the Software or utilizes the software for illegal, disruptive or other inappropriate purposes. 
</p>

<h2>
5. FEES AND EXPENSES:
</h2>

<p>
 TeamFluent waives all other subscription and usage fees during the 14-day trial period. 
</p>

<h2>
6. CONFIDENTIALITY:
</h2>

<p>
 “Confidential Information” means any information or data (including without limitation any formula, pattern, compilation, program, device, method, technique, or process) that is disclosed by one party (a “disclosing party”) to the other party (a “receiving party”) pursuant to this Agreement. Confidential Information of TeamFluent includes, but is not limited to, the terms of this Agreement; the Software, as well as the structure, organization, design, algorithms, methods, survey items, themes, templates, data models, data structures, flow charts, logic flow, and screen displays associated with such Software. Confidential Information does not include information that: (a) is or becomes publicly known or available without breach of this Agreement; (b) is received by a receiving party from a third party without breach of any obligation of confidentiality; or (c) was previously known by the receiving party as shown by its written records. 
</p>

<p>
A receiving party agrees: (a) to hold the disclosing party’s Confidential Information in strict confidence; and (b) except as expressly authorized by this Agreement, not to, directly or indirectly, use, disclose, copy, transfer or allow access to the Confidential Information. In addition, without limiting the foregoing, TeamFluent agrees to use, and to require its contractors to use, reasonable procedures and mechanisms to maintain the security of and to prevent the unauthorized access to the computer systems on which End User’s Confidential Information resides. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a receiving party may disclose Confidential Information of the disclosing party as required by law or court order; in such event, such party shall use its best efforts to inform the other party prior to any such required disclosure. 
</p>

<p>
Each party acknowledges and agrees that any violation of this Section 6 or the intellectual property rights of TeamFluent may cause the disclosing party irreparable injury for which the disclosing party would have no adequate remedy at law, and that the disclosing party shall be entitled to preliminary and other injunctive relief against the receiving party for any such violation. Such injunctive relief shall be in addition to, and in no way in limitation of, all other remedies or rights that disclosing party shall have at law or in equity. 
</p>

<h2>
7. TERM OF AGREEMENT:
</h2>

<p>
 The Term of this license agreement is 14 calendar days, beginning with the date the agreement is accepted by the End User – as set forth in Section 3. 
</p>

<h2>
8. LIABILITY:
</h2>

<p>
 In no event shall either party be liable for special, consequential, incidental, indirect or punitive loss, damage or expenses whether arising in contract or tort (including but not limited to lost profits, savings, data, or the cost of recreating lost data), even if it has been advised of their possible existence. 
</p>

<h2>
9. INDEMNIFICATION:
</h2>

<p>
 If a claim of copyright, patent, trade secret, or other intellectual property rights violation is made against End User relating to the Software, End User agrees to immediately notify TeamFluent, allow TeamFluent to control the litigation or settlement of such claim, and cooperate with TeamFluent in the investigation, defense, and/or settlement thereof. TeamFluent agrees to take control of the litigation and indemnify the End User by paying any settlement approved by TeamFluent, or any judgment, costs, or attorneys’ fees finally awarded against the End User for such claim. End User may participate at End User’s own expense. This indemnification obligation does not apply to the extent the claim is based on a combination of Software with other software, or any modification to the Software, if such claim would not have been made but for the combination or modification. If such a claim is made or, in TeamFluent’s opinion, is likely to be made, TeamFluent, at its sole discretion, may modify the Software, obtain rights for the End User to continue using the Software, or terminate the agreement for the Software. 
</p>

<h2>
10. MISCELLANEOUS:

<p>
 Neither party shall be liable for any failure or delay in the performance of its obligations due to causes beyond the reasonable control of the party affected, including but not limited to war, sabotage, insurrection, riot or other act of civil disobedience, strikes or other labor shortages, act of any government affecting the terms hereof, accident, fire, explosion, flood, hurricane, severe weather or other act of God. 
</p>

<h2>
11. TECHNICAL SUPPORT:
</h2>

<p>
 During the 14-day Trial Period, TeamFluent will provide e-mail technical and phone support to the End User. TeamFluent will attempt to respond to e-mail requests for technical support within one business day (24 hours); phone response within 4 hours.
